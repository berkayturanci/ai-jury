# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Public CLI compatibility contract: `tests/test_cli_contract.py` locks the
  CLI's flags, `--help` text (width/color-pinned golden under `tests/golden/`),
  error messages, exit codes, and report headings, with a documented stability
  policy in the README. **Breaking changes to these surfaces require a
  CHANGELOG entry.**

- Multi-version, multi-OS CI test matrix (Python 3.11–3.13 on Linux; 3.13 on
  macOS and Windows) covering unit tests and the mock CLI smoke test.
- OpenSSF Scorecard, CodeQL (Python), and Dependabot automation for supply-chain
  and repository-security signals, plus a documented dependency-update policy.
- Ecosystem comparison & capability matrix (`docs/comparison.md`) positioning the
  project against hosted, API-level, and other native-CLI review tools.
- Agent-readable docs: `llms.txt` (concise) and `llms-full.txt` (full reference).
- Public release readiness checklist (`docs/release-checklist.md`).
- Claude Code plugin distribution: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` make the repo installable as a single-plugin
  marketplace, reusing the existing `skill/` without moving it.
- Platform support matrix (`docs/platforms.md`) with honest per-platform statuses
  (supported / manual / planned / out of scope) and install snippets.
- Polished README hero visual (`docs/assets/hero.svg` + rendered `hero.png`) with
  meaningful alt text and the project tagline.
- Static landing site under `website/` (HTML/CSS, no build step) reusing the hero asset,
  plus a GitHub Pages deploy workflow and local-preview/custom-domain instructions.
